DoxyToEcma
==========

This tool is used to bring API docs generated by Doxygen on
Objective-C APIs into a MonoTouch or Xamarin.Mac binding being
documented with Mono's documetation pipeline.

To use, first make sure your doxygen.config is setup to generate
XML documentation, by setting the GENERATE_XML variable to YES.
Then run doxygen:

	doxygen myDoxygen.config

That will generate an "xml" directory with the docs.  If you have
not generated your docs, run:

	mdoc update Foo.dll -out:Docs

Then import the doxygen docs into a MonoDoc maintained

	mono DoxyToEcma.exe ECMA_DIR DOXY_DIR
